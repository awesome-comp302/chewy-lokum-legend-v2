#Meeting Agenda : December 26

##Issues:

 - Implementing “Special Moves” requires a change in move validation code
 - We need to get rid of the main “while loop” that drives the game and rely on the GUI events instead
 - We have issues with using images to show lokum types
 - Need to find an efficient way of animating

##Resolved Issues:
 - [None]

##Assessment of Success:
	Well – completed design phase, figured out JUnit, and got everyone up to speed on Github

##Plan for next week(s):
 - Figure out Graphics issues
 - refactor main application class
 - finish implementing new requirements
 - decide on/implement system to easily animate all events
##Issues to be clarified by TA:
- [None]
