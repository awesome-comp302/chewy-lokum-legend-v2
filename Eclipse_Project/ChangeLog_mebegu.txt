require looping, when it used. Now, method has its own
loop cycle.

###########

b.   fillAllNothingsRandomly(), isThereNothing(), 
isThereAvailableMove(),and dropAll()'s visibility changed
from public to private due to the change of update method.
They do not need to be called from outside of class.
